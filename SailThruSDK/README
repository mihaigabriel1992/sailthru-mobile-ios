Sailthru's iOS SDK for Push Notifications and User Tracking
Version 3.3.0

May 12, 2014
----------------------------------------------

First time SDK users should first read the "Process to First Incorporate this SDK" section,
then "How to Incorporate the SailthruSDK in your App". If just updating, please use
the latest header files along with the library version appropriate for your app's "Deployment"
target.


Version Changes:
---------------
- 3.3.0
  * Improved Anonymous -> Email -> Anonymous -> Email registration handling
  * Properly handle to back-to-back registration messages
  * General code improvements, hardening, and additional logging messages
  * Instructions on appending crash reports with Sailthru log info (bottom of this file)

- 3.2.7
  * Namespaced 'kReachabilityChangedNotification' to 'STkReachabilityChangedNotification'
- 3.2.6
  * Changes to the README, and first release available on the web.
  * Removed "optional" link to "Core Location" (previous Xcode required for use of CLLocation.h)
- 3.2.5
  * STManager.h makes extensive use of doxygen now that Xcode 5 uses it for command
	completion and Quick Help (Option-tap a method)
  * appended info on how Sailthru processes tags to this document, and a link
  * new "version" method in STManager, will currently return @"3.2.5"
  * resolved an issue causing some anonymous registrations to fail
  * the SDK previously used two files, now just one
  * all data stored in the single file now completely encrypted (tags and URLs, etc)
  * all network transmission now uses HTTPS
  * a few methods were deprecated - please switch to the indicated replacement
- 3.2.0 - 3.2.2
  * increased error checking for several input parameters
  * tuned iOS7 networking code
- 3.1.0
  * small bugs fixes, address Xcode warnings
- 3.0.0
  * added methods to access the Sailthru Recommendation service
- 2.0.0
  * an iOS 7.0 library was added. The primary difference between it and the iOS6 library is that 
  it uses the new NSURLSession instead of NSURLConnection (but does not do background transmission).
  * the iOS5.1 library was pulled. If anyone really needs it, just ask and we'll re-enable it for you.


Often asked questions
------------------------------------------

- the library "optionally" links the 'Foundation' and 'SystemConfiguration' frameworks

- this SDK does not use categories on anything other than its own classes, which all use
  an "ST" prefix

- every line of code in this SDK is under our control - we use no external large networking
  (or other) frameworks
  
- it saves o file (marked with "Do Not Backup") in the file system, and all the contained data
  stored is encrypted

- all network connections use HTTPS

- the library contains the original symbols, to better guide crash analysis

- what is the code size of the library? There is no simple answer to this - the library (.a file)
  has architectures lipo'd into it for all valid device and simulator architectures, as well as
  debugging information to assist clients and Sailthru resolve crashes or other issues (this
  information would normally be stripped from a client app). A Q&A on StackOverflow shows at 
  least one technique you can use to determine the stripped size of one architecture: 
    http://stackoverflow.com/q/22995744/1633251
  For the 3.2.7 library, arm64, the size is about 160,000 bytes.


Process to First Incorporate this SDK
-------------------------------------

1) Register your App with Sailthru. 

   You will need to provide the push certifcate (in .p12 format), 
   your app's bundleID, and select "dev" or "prod" (telling 
   Sailthru which APNS to use). Sailthru returns an "app_id", which
   you must supply to the SDK along with your "api_key".
   
   Note that you will most likely register your app twice: once for
   development (using the dev APNS), and once for the App Store release
   (using the production APNS).
   
   To enable your account for mobile use, please contact your Sailthru Acccount
   Manager. You will register the app then using the "Mobile" option 
   under the "Settings" menu in my.sailthru.com 
   
2) Incorporate the SDK into your App.

   The SDK is provided as a library with header files, one for iOS 6.0 and one 
   for 7.0. Newer libraries use newer more efficient APIs, so please use the 
   version applicable for your "Deployment" target. You copy it out of the 
   SailthruSDKdemo folder into your project.

3) Instantiate the STManager object and register your app.

   See the STManager.h file for the specifics of the registration call. It
   returns an immediate indication as to whether all parameters appear reasonable
   (meaning you could assert on the return code in dev builds). It then registers 
   in the background and messages the delegate when registration
   succeeds or fails (failure is almost for sure a typo or reversed parameter). If 
   the network is slow or unavailable this process may take some time.
   
4) Send tracking info.

   See STEvent for the two types of tracking events - tags and urls. Your app 
   can start recording these immediately after instantiating the STManager shared object,
   as the library stores them until the registration completes or the network becomes available.
   A link to Sailthru's docuementation on tags is appended at the bottom of this readme. Note
   that generally you want to use the same tags in the app as on the web (assuming a web
   presence), as that will better focus our recommendation engine.

5) Push Notifications

   Push notifications get sent using the existing user contact infastructure, either from 
   the web interface or using the Sailthru API.
   
   When your app receives a push notification from Sailthru, you should call a method on
   STManager so it can extract the message ID. Subsequent messages get tagged with this ID
   automatically by the SDK, and you have control over when the tagging stops, either by selecting 
   one of the options (or accepting the default), or by directly messaging  the STManager.

6) Prepare for Development and Production Builds

   Sailthru generates two different appIDs when you define both Development and a Production apps.
   Since the registration call needs to know which of the two its registering, you need to change 
   two parameters when chosing one or the other. A good way to do this automatically in Xcode is to
   set a preprocessor define for the Production build, and possibly add a warning when building
   for Development, so you cannot accidentally build using the incorrect information.

   #ifdef DEPLOYMENT
     STPushNoteMode apnsMode = stProductionMode;
	 NSString *appID = @"....";
   #else
     STPushNoteMode apnsMode = stDevelopmentMode;
	 NSString *appID = @"....";
	 #warning Sailthru Registration using Development Mode.
   #endif

Notes:

a) thread-safety
   
   Messages to the STManager singleton should be sent on the main queue, but other 
   event tracking messages can be sent on any thread/dispatch_queue. All delegate messages
   arrive on the main queue. [If you'd like the ability to specify a delegate
   queue just ask.]

b) categories
  
   The Sailthru library only uses categories on its own classes, all of which use the "ST" prefix.

c) Apple has some great material to assist in debugging push notification problems. 
 - Read this StackOverFlow answer: http://stackoverflow.com/a/20110555/1633251. This article
   has a reference to an internal Apple Dev forum on how to install tracking profiles (that
   as of today don't work with iOS7).
 - Apple TN2265: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2265/_index.html
 - Sailthru has an article on how to use "my.sailthru.com" to send test push notifications. Just
   ask your Account Manager for a copy.


Process to First Incorporate this SDKHow to Incorporate the SailthruSDK in your App
----------------------------------------------

1) Copy the SailthruSDK folder to the app folder, which contains the ".xcodeproj" project file,
   then add the directory to your project, but don't add it to any targets (unselect the checkbox).
   
2) Add the appropriate library (iOS 6.0 or 7.0) folder, by going to your target's
   Build Phase tab, Link Binary with Libraries, tap on "+", then navigate to the appropriate
   folder and select libSailthru.a

3) Add the following to the Project's Build Settings:

  * Search Paths -> Library Search Paths: $PROJECT_DIR/SailthruSDK/ios<version>
  * Search Paths -> User Header Search Paths: $PROJECT_DIR/SailthruSDK
  * Linking -> Other Link Flags: -ObjC  NOTE: If you fail to do this, your app will crash on launch.

4) Add #import "SailthruSDK" line to AppDelegate and wherever else you want 
   to use the SDK, or add it to your pch file.

5) Add the STManager and STManagerDelegate code as found in AppDelegate. Essentially you need
   to instantiate the STManager singleton, then register your app. If you want to test in the Simulator,
   you need to get a push token from a run on a device, then hard copy that to your app in 
   didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError method (shown in the demo app).

6) Samples of sending a tracking event are in ViewController.m. You get two flavors of events: URLs and tags.

7) Spend a few moments browsing the three ST... headers. There are methods to select more or less logging, 
   redirect logging to an object in your app, and options on when push notifications message IDs should
   stop being associated with events.

8) The libSailthru library has support for armv7, armv7s, and armv64, and i386.

Tag format (from Sender.h, which is the definitive reference)
----------

 Each tag is processed by Sailthru as follows
 - the string is trimmed, that is leading and trailing white space is removed
 - all underscores, non-alphanumeric characters, and remaining whitespace get converted to dashes
 - all upper case characers are converted to lower case
 - if the result is a number, or starts with a number, it's discarded
 - finally, if the resultant string is longer than 32 characters, its truncated to that length

More data on tags can be found at this URL:

Augment Crash Reports With Log Information
------------------------------------------

Many apps are using a crash logging service such as Crashlytics and BugSense. At least the two
referenced here support attaching some of the logging information generated by our app. This SDK
can output logging information at a variety of levels. The lowest level, stInformative (see STLog.h),
outputs a huge stream of info. The highest level, stCatastrophic, may not cause any output.

By implementing the STLogging protocol, you can add one method to any persistent object in your app, 
and provide it to your service's SDK. This information can prove of invaluable help to Sailthru
if you end up having a crash in our SDK.

Specifically,

1) Import the log header:

#import "STLog.h"

2) Add conformance to the protocol:

@interface MyObject () <STLogging>

3) Early on make yourself the delegate and set the threshold to stWarning. Note that you can
do this independantly of when you instantiate the STManager.

	stSetLogger(self);
	stSetLogThreshold(stWarning); // try stInformative and dump messages to the console just to verify its all working

4) Implement the required method in your app:

	- (void)logStMessage:(NSString *)msg
	{
		// Messages arrive from a variety of threads, and have a "[stlog]" prefix
		... // Service Specific or NSLog(@"%@", msg) just to see that its all working
	}

Crashlytics:
	- (void)logStMessage:(NSString *)msg
	{
		CLS_LOG(@"%@", msg);
	}

BugSense:

Create an NSDictionary with the data that you want to send:

(BOOL) application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions 
{
    NSDictionary *aNiceLittleDictionary = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:@"myObject", @"myKey", nil];
    ...
    [BugSenseController sharedControllerWithBugSenseAPIKey:@"<Your BugSense API Key>"userDictionary:aNiceLittleDictionary];

   //...
}

The first argument is the BugSense API key (NSString). The second argument is an NSDictionary with custom data. 
Calling this method again will not let you redefine the data for this instance of the crash controller.

There are two ways to use custom data in your application. In standard mode, the crash controller sends the crash report 
on relaunch and uses the custom data that you provide in the factory method, as is. In immediate dispatch mode, 
it often makes sense to use an NSMutableDictionary, keep a reference to it and update the data as you go along.

The mutable dictionary would contain an array of log messages, which means the client app
needs to maintain a mutable array with say up to 25 messages, and as new log messages arrive, delete the first (oldest)
and replace it with the newer one. On a crash, if you immediately report, the array will be current. If you don't
report until the next launch, then save the log array to a file, and reload it at launch.
